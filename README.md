# Review and Reformulation of the Sea Lion Optimization Metaheurestic
## Paper located [here](./SeaLionSummary.pdf).

Abstract: The Sea Lion Optimization Algorithm (SLnO) is a recent metaheruistic optimization algorithm suitable for optimizing given functions over given search spaces. Its biphasic behavior helps find minima in many circumstances, including unimodal and multimodal distributions. We present the most concise and best articulated formulation of SLnO to date, identify shortcomings in the original formulation, and summarize the strengths of SLnO.
